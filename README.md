# 🎯 Guess the Number Game (Java)

A simple console-based number guessing game written in Java. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player is prompted to guess the number.
3. The program gives hints:
   - "Too high!" if the guess is greater than the number.
   - "Too low!" if the guess is less than the number.
4. The game continues until the player guesses correctly.
5. Displays the total number of attempts taken.
